# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics: Textbook Introduction

Welcome to the comprehensive textbook on Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics. This textbook is designed to provide a thorough understanding of the cutting-edge technologies and methodologies that are shaping the future of robotics.

## About This Textbook

This textbook covers the essential components of modern humanoid robotics systems, including:

- **ROS2 (Robot Operating System 2)**: The middleware framework for robotics applications
- **Gazebo**: The simulation environment for robotics development
- **NVIDIA Isaac**: The AI-powered robotics platform for perception and manipulation
- **VLA (Vision-Language-Action)**: The multimodal AI systems for robot cognition

## Target Audience

This textbook is designed for:
- Graduate students in robotics, AI, and computer science
- Researchers working in physical AI and humanoid robotics
- Engineers developing robotic systems
- Anyone interested in the intersection of AI and robotics

## How to Use This Textbook

Each module is structured to provide both theoretical foundations and practical implementation. We recommend following the modules in sequence, as later concepts build on earlier ones. However, each module is also designed to be accessible independently for those with prior knowledge.

## Prerequisites

Readers should have:
- Basic programming experience (Python/C++)
- Understanding of linear algebra and calculus
- Familiarity with machine learning concepts
- Basic knowledge of physics and mechanics (helpful but not required)

Let's begin our journey into the fascinating world of Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics.
