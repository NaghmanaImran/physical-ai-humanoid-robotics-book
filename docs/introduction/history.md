# History and Evolution of Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics

## Early Foundations (1940s-1970s)

The concept of artificial beings that mimic humans can be traced back to ancient myths, but the modern era of robotics began in the mid-20th century:

- **1948**: W. Grey Walter's "tortoises" - early autonomous robots that could navigate and respond to their environment
- **1954**: George Devol patents the first programmable robot, Unimate
- **1961**: Unimate begins work at General Motors, marking the first industrial robot
- **1966**: Shakey the Robot at Stanford Research Institute - first mobile robot with reasoning capabilities

## The Rise of Humanoid Research (1970s-1990s)

The development of humanoid robots gained momentum during this period:

- **1973**: WABOT-1 at Waseda University - first full-scale anthropomorphic robot
- **1984**: Honda begins development of humanoid robots
- **1996**: Honda's P2 - first humanoid to walk outdoors
- **1997**: Sony's AIBO - robotic dog that demonstrated consumer robotics potential

## Modern Era and Physical AI (2000s-Present)

The 21st century has seen rapid advancement in both hardware and AI:

- **2000**: Honda's ASIMO - advanced humanoid with autonomous capabilities
- **2004**: DARPA Grand Challenge - spurs development of autonomous systems
- **2010s**: Rise of deep learning transforms robot perception
- **2015**: Google's LAIR and other learning systems demonstrate robot learning from physical interaction
- **2020s**: Integration of large language models with robotic systems
