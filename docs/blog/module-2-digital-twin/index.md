# Module 2: The Digital Twin

## Focus
Physics simulation and environment building

<!-- truncate -->

The Digital Twin module is a cornerstone of modern robotics development, focusing on creating realistic virtual environments where robots can be tested, trained, and validated before deployment in the real world. This module combines the physics simulation capabilities of Gazebo with the high-fidelity rendering of Unity to create comprehensive digital replicas of physical systems.

In this module, students will learn to construct detailed virtual environments that accurately represent real-world physics, enabling safe and cost-effective robot development. The module covers both the theoretical foundations of physics simulation and practical implementation techniques.

Key learning outcomes include:
- Understanding the principles of physics simulation in robotics
- Creating realistic environments for robot testing and training
- Implementing sensor simulation for comprehensive testing
- Validating robot behaviors in virtual environments before real-world deployment

This approach allows for rapid iteration and testing without the risks and costs associated with physical robot trials, making it an essential skill for modern robotics engineers.
