# Module 4: Vision-Language-Action

## Focus
Convergence of LLMs and Robotics

<!-- truncate -->

The Vision-Language-Action (VLA) module represents the cutting edge of human-robot interaction, combining computer vision, natural language processing, and robotic action execution. This module explores how large language models can be integrated with robotic systems to enable natural, intuitive interaction between humans and robots.

Students will learn to build systems that can understand human commands expressed in natural language, perceive the environment through computer vision, and execute complex tasks through robotic manipulation. This module bridges the gap between high-level cognitive functions and low-level robotic control.

Key learning outcomes include:
- Integrating large language models with robotic systems
- Implementing vision-language-action pipelines
- Creating intuitive human-robot interfaces
- Developing cognitive planning systems that translate language to actions

The module culminates in a capstone project where students implement an autonomous humanoid robot capable of understanding and executing complex tasks through vision, language understanding, and physical manipulation.
