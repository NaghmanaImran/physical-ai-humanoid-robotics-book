## Implementation Plan

### Content Mapping to Docusaurus
- Create comprehensive content covering both Gazebo and Unity simulation environments
- Structure content to match the existing gazebo documentation in docs/gazebo/
- Ensure hands-on labs provide practical experience with both platforms
- Include diagrams and screenshots to illustrate concepts

### Implementation Steps
1. Map existing Gazebo content from docs/gazebo/ to the new specification
2. Add Unity-specific content and examples
3. Create detailed lab instructions with expected outcomes
4. Add relevant diagrams, screenshots, and code snippets
5. Ensure the content flows logically from basic concepts to advanced simulation
6. Link to external resources and official documentation for both platforms

### Timeline
- Content mapping and enhancement: 3-4 days
- Unity content creation: 2-3 days
- Lab development: 2-3 days
- Review and integration: 1-2 days
