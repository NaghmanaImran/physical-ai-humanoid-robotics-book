## Implementation Plan

### Content Mapping to Docusaurus
- Create a comprehensive module on ROS 2 with practical examples
- Structure the content to match the existing ROS 2 documentation in the docs folder
- Ensure each subsection has clear learning objectives and hands-on exercises
- Include code examples and diagrams to illustrate concepts

### Implementation Steps
1. Map existing ROS 2 content from docs/ros2/ to the new specification
2. Enhance content with practical examples and exercises
3. Create detailed lab instructions with expected outcomes
4. Add relevant diagrams and code snippets
5. Ensure the content flows logically from basic concepts to practical implementation
6. Link to external resources and official ROS 2 documentation

### Timeline
- Content mapping and enhancement: 3-4 days
- Lab development: 2-3 days
- Review and integration: 1-2 days
