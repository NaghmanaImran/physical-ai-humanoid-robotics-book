# 005-capstone: Capstone Project - Autonomous Humanoid

## Title
Capstone Project - Autonomous Humanoid

## Focus
This capstone project integrates all modules to create an autonomous humanoid robot that can perceive its environment, understand natural language commands, plan actions, and execute complex tasks. Students will synthesize knowledge from all previous modules to build a complete robotic system.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this capstone project, students will be able to:
- Synthesize knowledge from all previous modules into a complete system
- Design and implement an autonomous humanoid robot system
- Integrate ROS 2, simulation, AI perception, and VLA capabilities
- Plan and execute a complex robotics project from concept to demonstration
- Troubleshoot and optimize multi-component robotic systems
- Document and present a complete robotics solution
