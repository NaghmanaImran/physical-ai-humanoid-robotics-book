4. Add relevant diagrams, screenshots, and code snippets
5. Ensure the content flows logically from basic concepts to advanced AI integration
6. Link to external resources and official NVIDIA Isaac documentation

### Timeline
- Content mapping and enhancement: 3-4 days
- Lab development: 2-3 days
- Review and integration: 1-2 days
